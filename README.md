# Hux frontend application
## Frontend Specifications
- Create a simple web interface for the backend service using React or Next.js. -
It should contain the following pages:
- Homepage - Shows some useful information about the web app
- Signup/Login page (or popup) - Allows a user to signup or login
- Create contact page - Contains a form for a user to add a new contact -
Edit contact page - Allows the user to update a contact information
- Contacts list page - Lists all saved contacts for the logged-in user
- Contact details page - Shows the full details of a saved contact
- Deleting contacts should be implemented on the Contacts list page or the Contacts
details page (or both).
- Logged-in users should be directed to the Contacts list page when they visit the site from a
new browser tab while anonymous visitors should be redirected to the Homepage. - Style the
application to make it visually appealing. It should be simple but intuitive. Do NOT use CSS
preprocessors (e.g., Sass, LESS, etc.), but you can use CSS frameworks (Bootstrap,
Tailwind CSS, etc.).
- The frontend should be highly responsive and follow web accessibility standards. -

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
